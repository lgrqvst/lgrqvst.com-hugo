{{% lede %}}"Travelers who have been to Essahjiyn say, that in the easternmost parts of the great desert, where the sands of the Valhd meet the foothills of the K'karraghs, there lives an old god of stone called Ahnemh. They say the nomads in that part of the Valhd believe that whoever can answer the god's riddle, shall receive true answers to any three questions they may ask, and that those who answer wrongly shall be struck down. They say no one has ever lived."{{% /lede %}}<!--more-->

{{% figure src="/img/art/illustration/before-the-stone-god.jpg" alt="A lone figure stands in front of a wasteland. In the distance mountains. A colossal hand rises from the ground some hundred meters ahead, looming threateningly. In the palm, an eye gazes at the viewer. Behind it all, in an otherworldly sky, a large, full moon rises." class="align-middle" %}}
