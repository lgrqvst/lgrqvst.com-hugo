Let's think about structure. With the different types of content I envision this site eventually hosting, how to I organize it all?

First, what _are_ the content types?

__Static pages__
For content that rarely or never changes, like an About page or a Contact page.

__blog/__
For blog posts, devblogs, essays, and articles of all kind. Written content that isn't fiction.

__portfolio/__
For items in the portfolio. This has low priority for now, but I'm gonna try to keep in the back of my mind.

__stuff/__
I'll probably call it something else (I'll definitely call it something elseâ€”maybe 'art' or 'creative'? Or something? 'creations'? 'works'? 'opuses'? Or maybe go for something more... conceptual? Figurative?), but basically this is for _things_ I make, whatever shape or form they may take. Maybe set up different types or categories for different types of content.

__Larger projects__
For things I make that are larger in scope, I think I'll just create a separate content section.
