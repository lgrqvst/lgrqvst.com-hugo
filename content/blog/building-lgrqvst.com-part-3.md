Let's think about structure. With the different types of content I envision this site eventually hosting, how to I organize it all?

First, what _are_ the content types?

__blog/__
For articles of all kind

__portfolio/__
For items in the portfolio

__stuff/__
I'll probably call it something else, but basically this is for things I make, whatever shape or form they may take. Maybe set up different types or categories for different types of content.

__projects/__
For things I make that are larger projects and which warrant more attention.
