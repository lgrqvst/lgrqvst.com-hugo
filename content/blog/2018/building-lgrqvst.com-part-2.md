What is the purpose of this site? I think that's important to define as a first step. Definitely, the lack of any kind of overarching vision of _why_ I had a website has been a part of the reason for why previous sites were ultimately abandoned. So let's take a moment to consider this.

For starters, I want a kind of central hub for my online presence. People that know me on Facebook might not know me on Twitter. People that have seen my photos on Instagram might be curious to find my GitHub profile, and so on. I don't have any illusions about me being all that interesting to be quite honest, but I feel like the least I can do is make things easy to find.

Secondly, portfolio

Third, blog

Fourth, spread art and stuff

Fifth, experiment with web and graphic design
