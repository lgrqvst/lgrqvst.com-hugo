I'm rebuilding my website. For those that have known me a long time, and to myself as well, this statement - "I'm rebuilding my website" - has almost taken on the quality of a joke. I have said it so many times, and actually done it quite a few times, but it always seems to end with me not putting in the time and effort of maintaining the site (for one reason or another). But I always keep coming back to the idea of a personal site. And I look at the site I abandoned a year earlier or two years earlier or three years earlier and think, "Well, this is no good. Let's rebuild."

And so,

Let's rebuild.

A lot has changed since the last time I had personal site, and I think that _I've_ changed a fair bit as well. So maybe it's not hopeless. Let's find out.
