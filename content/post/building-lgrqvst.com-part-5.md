I don't have any mockups or psd files with a thought-out design for this site, but I do have a few ideas I want to make happen.

I want it to be overall a light site, and I want to have a low-key textured background, like a light paper texture. I want the body text to be in a serif font, and I will probably set headings in a sans-serif font. I want the site to be mostly black and white, with a single color here and there providing some contrast.
