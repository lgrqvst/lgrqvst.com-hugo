Here's some of what needs doing to bring this ship to port. There's probably more that should go here. Honestly I'm just winging this whole thing.
<!--more-->

- [x] Make a to-do list

_or_

- [ ] Social media links
- [ ] Blog categories?
- [ ] License?
- [ ] Art themes? Motifs?

## Styling

- [ ] Create watercolor splashes
- [ ] Watercolor splashes should not be part of the lede, but part of the page, maybe main? Consider.

- [ ] Put smaller splashes of color on headings? Try it out.
- [ ] Style code blocks better
