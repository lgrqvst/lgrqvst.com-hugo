Here's some of what needs doing to bring this ship to port. There's probably more that should go here. Honestly I'm just winging this whole thing.

<!--more-->

- [x] Make a to-do list

## Content

- [x] ~~Write something up for the About page~~
- [x] ~~Write something up for the Now page~~
- [x] ~~Write something up for the Contact page~~ (Honestly, these are fine for now)
- [x] Put a form on the contact page

## Functionality

- [x] Add a section for art on the home page
- [ ] Make the menu (decide what to put in it)  
       _or_
- [ ] Remove the menu (do I even need a menu? Maybe just go with the temporary one I made? Maybe make it into a search function? Is there an easy way to do that with Hugo?)
- [ ] Some sort of home page navigation to quickly jump to the Art section, and back up? A lot of scrolling on mobile :/
- [ ] Show art type on the post on the home page and category listing
- [ ] Maybe an automatic list of contents for blog posts that contain multiple headings? Something akin to [this pen](https://codepen.io/von_designs/pen/jXQqaR) perhaps

## Accessibility

- [ ] Lots to do, I'm sure
- [ ] ARIA
- [ ] Contrast between text and background for readability
- [ ] Make sure reader mode works
- [ ] Create a fallback for browsers that don't support grid

## Footer

- [x] Complete the footer
- [x] First, decide on what to put in the footer
- [x] Social media links
- [x] Blog categories?
- [x] License?
- [x] Static page links?
- [x] Tags
- [ ] Art types. At present: Short Stories, Illustrations.

## Styling

- [ ] Create more and original watercolor splashes
- [ ] Watercolor splashes should not be part of `.lede`, but part of the page
- [ ] There should be more than one watercolor splash
- [ ] Make the lede shortcode accept a class to control watercolor, or if I change them to be part of the page, have the page accept a param to determine which one to use. Or make it random maybe? (In general, some more randomness on this site would be nice)
- [ ] Put smaller splashes of color on headings? Try it out
- [ ] Style code blocks better
- [ ] Change the appearance of selections
- [ ] Maybe restyle `.lede`?

## Posts

- [ ] Default header image for posts
- [ ] Consider adding header images to the existing posts (all or some)
- [x] Comments on posts
- [ ] Add a _Show comments_ button and stop Disqus section from loading until user presses the button
- [ ] Show tags on post single view
- [ ] Show categories on post single view
- [x] Put the author name somewhere on posts
- [x] Put the date somewhere on posts
- [x] Make .lede paragraph into a shortcode to fix double `<p>` markup (Mostly solved I think)
- [ ] Links to next and previous post in category (categories?)
- [ ] Related posts?
- [x] On lists, add header images where available
- [ ] On e.g. category listings, distinguish between `posts` and `art`
- [ ] On art pages, display themes, motifs, &c.

## Other

- [ ] Favicons
- [ ] 404 page
- [ ] RSS feed (maybe?)
- [ ] Figure out image hosting situation.
- [ ] Add image gulp optimization not just for theme images

## Learn

- [x] ~~Hugo and Go~~ For now, just googling problems when they come up seems to work fine
- [x] Fuckin shortcodes, how do they work?
- [x] Disqus comments
